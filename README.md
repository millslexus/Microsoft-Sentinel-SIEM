# Microsoft-Sentinel-SIEM



 
<h2>Description</h2>
Discover the power of Microsoft Sentinel with this step-by-step guide showcasing my work. I successfully set up Microsoft Sentinel as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and connected it to a live virtual machine that acted as a honeypot. Real-time attacks, including RDP Brute Force, were observed from various parts of the world. A custom PowerShell script was utilized to identify the attacker's geolocation information and I was able to visualize it on the Azure Sentinel map through detailed screenshots
